## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Solana Lottery Project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Rust
- Solana CLI
- Anchor
- Node.js
  and
- Yarn

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Rust

Rust is essential for building the smart contracts.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup update
rustup component add rustfmt
```

### 2. Install Solana CLI

The Solana CLI is necessary for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

Go to
https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/releases , then e.g. for mac intel and version v.1.18.22 download

```bash
wget https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/releases/download/v1.18.22/solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd solana-release
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH >.bashrc or .zshrc

source .bashrc or .zshrc
solana --version

#solana-cli 1.18.22 (src:9efdd74b; feat:4215500110, client:Agave)
```

### 3. Install Anchor

Anchor is a crucial framework for developing Solana programs.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor --tag v0.30.1 anchor-cli
avm --version
anchor --version
```

### 4. Install Node.js and Yarn

For the frontend, ensure you have Node.js and Yarn installed.

#### Install Node.js

```bash
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash

# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 20

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.16.0`

# verifies the right npm version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.8.1`
```

#### Install Yarn

```bash
sudo npm install --global yarn
```

### 5. Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/TheDataDudeDE/lottery.git
cd lottery
```

### Finally check versions

```bash
solana --version; node -v; yarn --version; anchor --version
solana-cli 1.18.22 (src:9efdd74b; feat:4215500110, client:Agave)
v20.16.0
1.22.22
anchor-cli 0.30.1
```

### 6. Build and Deploy

Compile and deploy the Solana smart contract using Anchor.

```bash
anchor build
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

### 7. Run the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the Vite development server.

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```
